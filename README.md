# Numato Lab AD9763 DAC Module

Numato Lab AD9763 DAC module tested using Numato Lab ElbertV2 FPGA board

## Getting Started

* install Xilinx ISE 14.7 webpack.
* Download or clone this project and open using Xilinx ISE.
* Code contains several modes(sine wave, triangle wave, etc.) which can be controlled using DIP switches of the FPGA board.
* Code is simple and you can do necessary modifications.
* Contraints are set to have the same values on both output channels.
* Sysnthesize RTL and Program FPGA.
* Enjoy..!
